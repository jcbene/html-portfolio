<h3>What to bring:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Yourself! (Be sure to cancel ALL plans (except for this one of course). This is a once in a lifetime event <i>if you ignore all my other birthdays</i>)</li>
  <li>Balloons, hats, birthday-decoration galore! (Seriously...)</li>
  <li>Food (My teeth and mouth work, so don't bother me...)</li>
  <li>An appetite (There will be lots of food - your food!)</li>
</ul>
