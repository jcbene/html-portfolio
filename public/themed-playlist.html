	<h1>Themed Playlist - Gray Areas</h1>
	<i><h2>Are we fine? Where do we go from here? - Such sentiments are present in this playlist that encapsulates the feelings amidst the throes of dying love.</h2></i>
	<hr>
	<p>Relationships. People fight, argue, and make mistakes - Some couples, of course, overcome these challenges and come out the other side as better people and an overall healthier relationship. Yet others, such as the situation being represented by these three songs, are for the unfortunate few who’ve found themselves unable to get past the issues. And these issues, in turn, have pushed things past a “point of no coming back” - the damage has been done, and all that’s left is the beginning of an end. A “Gray Area”.</p>

    <p>In this song, bbno$ delves into a style of music not usual for an artist such as himself. Being an established rapper, “help herself” is a song quite unlike the others present in his discography, opting for a more vulnerable and sincere tone in contrast to the usual “trap/Soundcloud-rap bangers” he’s known for. In it, he professes his regret at an admittedly faulty relationship, one in which he, himself, is not at all invested in any longer. It’s this emotional vacancy and lack of a true-commitment that he feels will only lead to his partner’s pain and this relationship’s inevitable demise. Carried forth by the impeccable production from the esteemed producer, Diamond Pistols, is a song that’s sure to tug at the heartstrings of anyone who’s ever been in a similar enough predicament.</p>

            She can't help herself at all
            She's falling deep in love
            Can't give you what you want
            My bad, I messed this up
            Can barely help myself
            I'm falling out of love
            Can't give you what you want
            My bad, I messed this up

	<p>In this contemporary smash-hit, Post Malone delivers yet another earworm-inducing alternative-pop ballad. “Circles”, off of his 3rd Studio Album Hollywood’s Bleeding, details a turbulent relationship between two people locked at odds. Where constant arguing, blaming, and petty mind-games lead to a feeling of futility, as the couple finds themselves breaking up, coming back, and ending things again to no apparent end. With lush guitars imbuing the song with a melody so melancholic, and a driving, steady mid-tempo beat to carry it forward - “Circles” is a certified jam that’s sure to leave you wanting more.</p>

            Seasons change and our love went cold
            Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
            Run away, but we're running in circles
            Run away, run away
            I dare you to do something
            I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
            Run away, but we're running in circles
            Run away, run away, run away

	<p>Ever find yourself longing over a past love? Perhaps, maybe, you dream up fantasies or muse over the far-fetched possibility of somehow getting back together again with an ex. In “Redeye”, Danish producer, Galimatias delivers a sensual RnB ballad addressed to a former lover whom he meets while visiting an old town from his past. The lover, now in a relationship with someone new, is admittedly unavailable. He expresses his vexation upon finding this out, illustrated through the sensual, longing, and gentle melodies present within the track, in contrast with the hard-hitting drums, emphasizing the longing and bitter regret that he feels for his lost love. “Redeye” is a bittersweet RnB masterpiece that you do not want to miss.</p>

            Came back, redeye to see you
            I heard you've got someone new
            I'm taking you from that guy
            Came back to tell you, you're mine
            Might see my face on the news
            If we'll be fighting for you
            I'm taking you from that guy
            Came back to tell you, you're mine
